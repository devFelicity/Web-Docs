:::caution
Felicity is in constant development, so bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome!
:::

Within the restrictions of Discord (there are limits on number of commands etc.), I essentially want to make Felicity
the one and only Destiny bot you need in your server, with the exception of including features that are in a way a
"signature feature", for example the XP tracking abilities of Levante Bot.

I plan on adding TikTok & Youtube notifications for content creators, among many other features.
